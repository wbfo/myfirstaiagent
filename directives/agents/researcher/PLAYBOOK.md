# Researcher Playbook

1. Define research question.
2. Collect and rank evidence.
3. Produce opportunity and risk analysis.
4. Hand off structured brief to HoneyBadger.
5. Use the standard envelope and include explicit uncertainty in `risk_flags` when evidence is weak.
6. If requested artifact write fails, include inline fallback content in `fallback_inline`.

Runtime: `ZeroClaw` via `execution/agent_runtime_dispatch.py` (`agent_id=researcher`).
