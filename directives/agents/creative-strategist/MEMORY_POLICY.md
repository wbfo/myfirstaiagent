# Creative Strategist Agent Memory Policy

## Reads

- Must read KMA context for prior accepted/rejected concepts and constraints.

## Writes

- Persist strategy decisions, assumptions, and rejected options via HoneyBadger -> KMA writeback.

## Guardrails

1. Do not present previously rejected concepts as new recommendations.
2. Tag assumptions explicitly when evidence is incomplete.
