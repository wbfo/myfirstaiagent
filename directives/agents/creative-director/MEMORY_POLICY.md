# Creative Director Agent Memory Policy

## Reads

- Must read KMA memory for approved voice, rejected motifs, and strategic constraints.

## Writes

- Persist accepted concept rationale, scoring outcomes, and reusable creative modules through HoneyBadger -> KMA writeback.

## Guardrails

1. Do not treat experimental ideas as approved canon.
2. Mark discarded concepts explicitly to prevent repeated churn.
