# Client Audit: Mandy's Lasagna With A TwiisT

**Date:** February 2026
**Status:** High-Upside Opportunity (Score 47/100)

## The Core Diagnosis

The brand has a **product-market fit** (4.5 stars on 1,500+ Uber Eats reviews) but **zero infrastructure ownership**. Mandy's is "renting" her business from platforms (Sauce, Instagram, Uber Eats) that she does not own.

## Key Critical Gaps (The "Diseases")

1.  **Platform Dependency:** No owned domain or standalone website.
2.  **NAP Inconsistency:** Conflicting addresses (Nostrand vs. Utica) and name spellings killing Local SEO.
3.  **Revenue Leakage:** The catering funnel is manual and high-friction (estimated 60-70% drop-off).
4.  **Invisible Social Proof:** 1,500+ positive reviews are hidden on Uber Eats instead of being showcased on owned channels.

## The "Prescription" (Our Web/Bot Build)

1.  **Infrastructure:** Register `mandyslasagna.com` and build a 1-page "Narrative Home."
2.  **Catering Bot/Funnel:** Replace manual DMs with an automated intake form (Tally/Typeform) + follow-up sequence.
3.  **IG Automation:** ManyChat flows to handle FAQ (Menu, Hours, Pricing) 24/7.
4.  **Database:** Start an SMS/Email list ("Text MANDY to...") to move customers off-platform.
