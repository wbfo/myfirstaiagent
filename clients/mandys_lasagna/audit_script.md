# Mandy's Lasagna - Audit Presentation Script

## The Goal

Move Mandy from "Third-Party Dependent" to "Business Owner with Assets." Show her the money leaking through catering and the lack of a digital "home."

---

### 1. The Opening (The "Wow" Factor)

"Mandy, I took a deep dive into your digital footprint. First off—**4.5 stars with over 1,500 reviews** on Uber Eats is incredible. You have one of the strongest reputations I’ve seen in this area. People clearly love the food."

### 2. The Problem (The "Leak")

"But here’s the thing: Right now, Uber Eats owns those customers, not you. They take a massive cut, and if their algorithm changes, your business is at risk.

More importantly, I noticed your **catering**. It’s basically hidden. When people search for 'best lasagna catering near me,' you’re not showing up because you don't have a dedicated website. You’re likely losing thousands in high-ticket catering orders every month simply because the process isn't automated or visible."

### 3. The Solution (The "Future")

"I’ve already started mapping out a solution for you. Here’s what I want to build to take this to the next level:

- **A Brand Hub:** A high-end website (Next.js/Tailwind) that showcases those 1,500 reviews and makes ordering/catering the main event.
- **Catering Automations:** An AI bot for your Instagram and website that handles catering quotes 24/7. No more missed DMs.
- **The NAP Fix:** We're going to clean up your Google listings so you rank #1 for lasagna in the city.

I’ve actually already drafted the first version of the site and a social calendar to get the momentum going. Want to see the mockup?"

## Technical Talking Points (If she asks 'How?')

- "We're using Next.js for speed—Google loves fast sites, which helps you rank higher."
- "The automation uses a simple AI logic: it qualifies the lead (How many people? What date?) before it even hits your phone, so you only talk to serious buyers."
