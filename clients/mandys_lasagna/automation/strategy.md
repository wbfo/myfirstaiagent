# AI Automation Strategy - Mandy's Lasagna

## 1. The "Lead-Gen" Chatbot (Website)

**Goal:** Capture catering leads while Mandy is busy in the kitchen.
**Logic:**

- **Trigger:** User clicks "Get a Quote" or stays on the Catering page for 30s.
- **Bot Questions:**
  1. "How many people are you feeding?"
  2. "What's the date of the event?"
  3. "What's your email/phone?"
- **Action:** Bot checks the "Catering Packages" price list and gives an _estimated_ quote instantly.
- **Closing:** "Mandy will text you in the next hour to finalize the details!" (Sends a notification to Mandy's phone via SMS/Slack).

## 2. Instagram "Auto-Reply" (ManyChat/DM)

**Goal:** Move people from "DMs" to "Orders."
**Logic:**

- **Trigger:** User DMs the word "MENU" or "CATERING".
- **Action:** Instantly sends the PDF menu and the link to the direct ordering site.
- **Value:** Saves Mandy 2 hours a day of answering "Where is the menu?" or "Do you cater?"

## 3. The "Review Booster" (Post-Purchase)

**Goal:** Push that 1,500 reviews to 2,000.
**Logic:**

- **Trigger:** 2 hours after a direct order is marked "Delivered."
- **Action:** Automated SMS: "Hope you loved the lasagna! Mind sharing the love? [Link to Google Business]"

## 4. Google Business Profile Sync

**Goal:** Keep NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistent.
**Logic:**

- Automated sync between the website hours and Google Business hours so she never has to update two places.
