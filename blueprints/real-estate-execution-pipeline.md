# Real Estate Execution Pipeline (The Loop)

This document outlines the end-to-end orchestration of real estate deals, from identification to stewardship.

## Phase 1: The Hunt (Identification)

**Objective:** Find off-market, undervalued, or high-potential assets.

- **Tools:** `FutureMap AI™`, `Deal Flow Commander`, Deep Research (Perplexity).
- **Target Assets:** Distressed 1-4 units (NJ), 5+ unit Multifamily (NYC), Opportunity Zone (OZ) development sites.

## Phase 2: Underwriting (The Viability Filter)

**Objective:** Confirm the numbers before committing resources.

- **Tool:** `AuditIQ-RE` (Snapshot Tool).
- **Key Metrics:** ARV (After Repair Value), MAO (Maximum Allowable Offer), NJEDA Credit potential.
- **Decision Gate:** Does it hit the ROI threshold? If NO, discard. If YES, move to Phase 3.

## Phase 3: The Capital Stack (Funding)

**Objective:** Secure the money based on the deal type.

| Layer | Type             | Source                       | Purpose                                                   |
| :---- | :--------------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A** | **Acquisition**  | Hard Money / Private Lenders | Fast close; "grabbing" the asset.                         |
| **B** | **Construction** | Draw-based Lending           | Funding the rehab/build.                                  |
| **C** | **Permanent**    | DSCR / Traditional Refi      | Refinancing out of high-interest debt for long-term hold. |

## Phase 4: Orchestration (Closing/Flipping)

**Objective:** Execute the legal and logistical closing.

- **The "Flip" Path:** Pitch to Institutional Buyer List (Greenbrook, TAY, etc.) or local flippers (Grinberg).
- **The "Keep" Path:** Legal setup, title work, and contractor onboarding.

## Phase 5: Stewardship (Management)

**Objective:** Operationalize the asset.

- **NYC OS:** Managing standard rentals/renovations.
- **STR Strategy:** Converting "Shed-to-Luxury" or high-end short-term rentals.
