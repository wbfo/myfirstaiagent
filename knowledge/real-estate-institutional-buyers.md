## The Legal Blockade (S1572 / A3009C)

- **The Impact:** Institutional investors face waiting periods and tax penalties for 1-4 unit Single Family Homes in NY.
- **The Pivot:** Money has moved to **New Jersey** (friendlier laws) or **Multifamily (5+ units)** in NYC (exempt).
- **Strategy:** Focus NYC pitches on Mixed-Use or 5+ Unit Multifamily. Use local "Mid-Market" guys for Single Family deals.
