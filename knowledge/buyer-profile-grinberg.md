---

## I. The "Buy Box" (Technical Criteria)

- **Asset Type:** 1-4 unit Residential up to small Multifamily.
- **Target Condition:** Distressed, needing renovation, or under-rented.
- **Unit Range:** Portfolio owner of 200+ properties.
- **Preferred Location:** Staten Island (core), Newark/NJ (expanding).

## II. Investment Strategy & Thesis

- **Core Strategy:** Institutional aggregation of scatter-site residential properties.
- **Financing Capability:** Strong private capital/internal funding; capable of "signing contracts" quickly for attractive deals.
- **Projected Value-Add:** Leverages internal management and construction expertise to stabilize distressed assets.

## III. The Pitch Blueprint (Honey Badger Context)

- **The Hook:** "I have an off-market Opportunity Zone deal in Newark with 8-story potential and $60M in tax credits."
- **Legislative Hedge:** As a "Mid-Market" operator, Dimitry can often navigate the NYC/NYS single-family restrictions (S1572) more flexibly than large PE firms like Greenbrook.
- **Target Opportunity:** 786-794 S 20th St (Newark OZ Deal).

## IV. Data Sources & Verification

- **Verified activity:** Active in current Newark negotiations; 200+ units verified in portfolio.
- **Strategic Notes:** Moves fast but requires "technical/local" validation for new markets (e.g., the Newark expert ball-drop). Needs active project oversight from Olatokunbo to maintain momentum.
