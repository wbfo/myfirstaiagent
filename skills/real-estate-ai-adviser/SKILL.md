# Real Estate AI Adviser

This skill provides a strategic framework for applying AI to real estate investing, focusing on the **Council Method** of multi-agent orchestration.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. The "Council Method" Workflow

Instead of relying on a single AI tool, use specialized agents for:

- **Acquisition Scouter:** Finding and filtering leads (FutureMap/Deal Flow).
- **Underwriting Analyst:** Validating comps and pricing logic (CMA/CBS/CIA).
- **Risk Auditor:** Checking Fair Housing compliance and hallucination detection.
- **Buyer Analyst:** Matching deals to institutional "Buy Boxes" (using `institutional-buyer-analyst`).

### 2. Risk Mitigation (HUD May 2024 Standards)

- **Tenant Screening:** Audit AI filters for proxy discrimination (zip code/eviction rate bias).
- **Fact Verification:** All AI-generated comps must be cross-referenced with local tax records or MLS data to prevent fraud.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Focus on the 5%:** Targets strategies that help investors move from simple adoption (88%) to successful objective achievement (5%).
- **Categorize by Investor Type:** Provide different playbooks for Wholesalers (Lead speed) vs. Developers (Project complexity).
- **Reference Benchmarks:** Use quantified efficiency gains (e.g., 75x matching speed) to justify implementation costs.
