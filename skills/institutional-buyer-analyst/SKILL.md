# Institutional Buyer Analyst

This skill transforms raw real estate data and entity names into decision-grade institutional profiles. It is optimized for the NYC/NJ market, focusing on Private Equity and large-scale aggregators.

## Workflow

To analyze a buyer, follow the structured process in [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md):

1.  **Map the Entity:** Identify parent companies and subsidiaries.
2.  **Define the Buy Box:** Pinpoint asset class, location, and condition preferences.
3.  **Audit Legislative Risk:** Evaluate vulnerability to S1572 and tenant-protection laws.
4.  **Generate Profile:** Use the standardized template in [assets/buyer-profile-template.md](assets/buyer-profile-template.md).

## Core Capabilities

- **Entity Intelligence:** Unmasking opaque LLCs to find the institutional driver.
- **Buy Box Reconstruction:** Reverse-engineering a buyer's recent portfolio to predict their next move.
- **Legislative Stress-Testing:** Analyzing how specific NY/NJ bills (e.g., S1572) impact the buyer's operational model.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Focus on Decision-Grade Output:** Avoid generic descriptions. Focus on _intent_, _capital sources_, and _yield requirements_.
- **Market Specificity:** Always prioritize data related to NYC (Brooklyn/Queens/Manhattan) and North Jersey (Jersey City/Newark).
