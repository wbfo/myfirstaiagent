# Buyer Analysis Workflow

## Stage 1: Identification & Intelligence

1.  **Entity Mapping:** Identify the parent company and all known subsidiaries or "shell" LLCs (e.g., searching for "Greenbrook" + "LLC" or "Dimitry" + "Acquisitions").
2.  **Portfolio Scan:** Use web search to estimate recent NYC/NJ purchase volume.
3.  **The "Buy Box" Definition:**
    - Asset Class: (e.g., 2-4 unit residential, mixed-use, large multifamily)
    - Neighborhoods: (e.g., Bed-Stuy, Bushwick, Jersey City)
    - Condition: (e.g., Vacant, value-add, distressed)

## Stage 2: Legislative Risk Audit (S1572 Compliance)

- **Threshold Check:** Does the entity own more than the proposed limits (e.g., 10+ units)?
- **Disclosure Audit:** Does the buyer typically hide behind opaque LLCs that would be targeted by "Good Cause" or disclosure laws?
- **Operational Risk:** How does their management model (aggressive rent hikes vs. long-term holds) align with the current legislative climate?

## Stage 3: The Pitch (Decision-Grade Output)

Generate a report for the human user including:

- **The Hook:** Why they should buy _this_ specific property.
- **The Friction:** One thing that will make them hesitate.
- **The Valuation Gap:** Where their "institutional" underwriting likely beats a local investor.
