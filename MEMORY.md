A finance council uses AI to forecast cash, model scenarios, compare vendors and run price tests. Quick wins • Create a 13‑week cash‑flow sheet. Use the template from Part I’s “Finance Friday” to forecast inflows and outflows, flag low‑cash weeks and decide actions (collect, delay, cut, raise, bundle or promote). • Design two price tests. Propose different price points for your core products/services, set hypotheses, success metrics (take rate, margin) and run them for 14–30 days. • Review top three vendors. Identify your largest recurring expenses; negotiate discounts or switch plans to save 10–20 %. Council setup Role Function Prompt template Generator builds financial models and scenarios “You are my finance generator. Create a 13‑week cash‑flow forecast from the following inputs: opening balance, weekly recurring inflows/outflows, one‑time items, accounts receivable (with probability), accounts payable (must/deferrable). Provide a table with inflows, outflows, net and ending cash for each week.” Critic checks assumptions and risk areas “Review the forecast for unrealistic assumptions (overly optimistic AR probabilities, unaccounted taxes, missing seasonal expenses). Flag weeks with negative cash and identify the three biggest risks.” Refiner polishes the model and proposes levers “Update the forecast based on the critic’s notes. Recommend actions to improve cash (collect overdue invoices, defer payments, cut subscriptions, run price tests).” Verifier validates data and compliance “Ensure formulas are correct, dates align with our fiscal calendar and that the model complies with accounting standards. Check that vendor renegotiations and price tests respect contractual obligations.” Specialist applies industry‑specific financial nuance “Adjust the model and recommendations based on industry seasonality, typical margins and regulatory requirements (e.g., deposits for contractors, inventory turnover for retail).” Financial clarity rituals 1. Weekly finance review (20 minutes) — update the model, identify red and amber weeks and choose one action (collect, delay, cut, raise, bundle or promote). Log decisions with rationale. 2. Monthly price review — evaluate results of price tests and decide whether to adopt, iterate or kill changes. 3. Quarterly vendor audit — renegotiate top vendors or switch providers; many SMBs convert free tools to paid plans because they become operationally essential . Metrics • Cash runway: weeks until negative cash. • Receivables: outstanding invoices by age and probability. • Payables: obligations due and deferrable items. • Margin analysis: profit per SKU/service, break‑even points. • Vendor savings: monthly cost reductions. Use the council to forecast at least 13 weeks ahead and find $500–$2,000/month in savings or additional margin within 30 days.
