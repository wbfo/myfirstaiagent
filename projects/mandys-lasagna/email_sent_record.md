# Email Record: To Mandy

**Subject:** Your Digital Audit is here, Mandy 🍝
**Date:** [Today, 3:25 PM]

Hey Mandy,

No worries at all — a domain is basically your address on the internet. Just like your restaurant has a physical address on Utica Ave, a domain (like `mandyslasagna.com`) is where people go to find you online. Right now that address is unclaimed, which is one of the things I flagged in the audit.

I've attached the full Sovereign Digital Audit for Mandy's Lasagna. It's a complete picture of your digital presence — what's working, what's quietly costing you, and what's leaving your brand exposed right now.

A few things I want you to pay attention to when you read it:

- **The NAP section (Section 03).** This one surprised me. Your business is showing up under two different addresses and three different name spellings across your platforms, and Google is penalizing you for it every single day.

- **The catering section (Section 05).** This is where I think the biggest immediate revenue opportunity is sitting.

- **The AI Search section (Section 06).** This is the part most people aren't talking about yet, but it matters a lot for where discovery is heading in 2026. Read through it, sit with it, and let me know what questions come up. We can jump on a call or keep it over text, whatever works better for you.

More to come.
